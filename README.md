# headliner
A progressive web app (PWA) for fetching news from two APIs. The production build is available on this :- http://soulsam480.github.io/headliner/
# Method
The app fetches latest news articles from two APIs which are <a href="https://newsapi.org">NewsApi.Org</a> and <a href="https://nytimes.com">New york Times API</a>.

It then uses javascript map function to map the data onto html tags and div elements for displaying the data.

The website is also an PWA(Progressive Web App) on Chrome and other supported browsers which uses the manifest file and a javascript service worker to make the site
installable as a native android app.

The PWA functionality enables the user to  use the app frequently and makes the process more convenient.

This app is free of any kind of copyright and it runs on the free version of the two apis.
